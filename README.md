# Simple digital-unit converter

Open the HTML file in any decent/recent web browser (that supports JavaScript).

Input the value in a field corresponding to the unit you want converted, and the
application will automatically populate the other fields with the converted value
in respective units.

# About

This is a simple application writen using [AngularJS]. This application works
completely within the browser, and does not send any data to the server. Hence
the conversions are instantaneous.

[AngularJS]: http://www.angularjs.org

Inspired by [Bit Calculator](http://www.matisse.net/bitcalc/), but that requires
that the user press a button, and the data is sent to the server, which performs
the calulation and sends the results back.

# TODO

Allow the user to specify whether a `kilo` means 1024 or 1000.
